% DMFIcode user instructions.

DMFIcode is a set of matlab routines. Your system requirements are therefore:

- MATLAB version > 7.0 

- A computer with a decent cpu, and most importantly, a decent graphic accelerator card for fast openGL rendering.

- Lots of hard disk space: DMFI works best when the time spacing between your G files is small, so you need many G files. As a rule of thumb, the spacing should be lower or equal to one tenth of the vortex turnover time 1/Urms, where Urms is the root-mean-squared velocity in the shell. 

This distribution has code for MAGIC and PARODY. The code produces the graphical output exactly as it is presented in Aubert et. al, GJI, 2008.

1) Put your graphic output files in the ForXXXX/Gfiles
2) Run the runDMFI.m routine in the ForXXXX/ subdirectory
3) Your jpeg output will appear in the ForXXXX/Frames subdirectory.

If you have trouble understanding the code, just drop an email to aubert@ipgp.jussieu.fr. The code is not guaranteed bug free, so if you find one, drop me an email as well...
